# üß† LLM Playbook with Experiments

A practical playground for exploring **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **LangGraph**, and **Deep Learning** fundamentals ‚Äî from linear algebra all the way to multi-agent orchestration and long-running durable systems.  

This repository represents my continuous journey as a **Machine Learning Engineer** and **Software Engineer** experimenting with the internals of AI systems and production-ready agent architectures.

## üß© Key Experiments & Learnings

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Core Foundations
- Implemented **attention mechanism** from scratch to understand transformer internals.
- Built simple **finite-state machines** to simulate agent reasoning.
- Practiced **LangGraph basics** (nodes, edges, conditions) to design structured reasoning flows.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieval-Augmented Memory
- Integrated **Ollama** (local LLMs like Llama-2 / Mistral) with **ChromaDB** for semantic retrieval.
- Implemented a **RAG pipeline** to enrich context dynamically during LLM responses.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-Agent Collaboration
- Created **Researcher ‚Üí Summarizer ‚Üí Answerer** workflow.
- Introduced caching, embedding persistence, and modular agents.
- Showcased **graph orchestration** using LangGraph to coordinate autonomous agents.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Long-Running & Durable Systems
- Implemented **durable execution** with `diskcache` and `tenacity` for retries.
- Added **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** corrections to simulate real feedback and preference learning.
- Designed persistent task states for resumable, production-grade pipelines.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ LangGraph Internals
- Studied graph anatomy: **nodes vs edges**, **conditional edges**, **state channels**, **checkpointing**, and **message passing**.
- Visualized graphs using Mermaid and Graphviz to understand data flow.

## üå± Why I‚Äôm Building This

Modern AI systems (like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini) are **not single models** ‚Äî  
they are **networks of reasoning agents**, **memory layers**, and **durable feedback loops**.

This repo is my effort to:
1. Understand **how LLM agents can be orchestrated** like microservices.  
2. Explore **long-running, stateful AI systems** beyond single-prompt inference.  
3. Combine **theory (math & DL)** with **practical agent engineering**.  
4. Prepare for **production-level AI development** (queue management, retries, persistence, feedback learning).

## üî≠ Future Scope

- Integrate **Celery + Redis** for distributed task orchestration.  
- Add **async workflows** and **pa**
