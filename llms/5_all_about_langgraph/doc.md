# Langgraph
Langgraph is a graph based orchestration framework for building agent pipelines(Multi step or multi agents).

Think like a state machine of LLMs - each node does some work(agent or function) and edges define how data flow 
between them.

### Analogy:
if node is station, edges are the rails between them.
